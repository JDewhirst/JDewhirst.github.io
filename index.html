            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p id="summary">
            Jack's degree in Physics deepened his mathematical literacy and analytical thinking. He found his passion for programming when exposed to it in Fortran and MATLAB as an undergraduate, he is currently training as a C# SDET.
            </p>   
            
            <p id="summary">
            In pursuit of the interest in programming he acquired during his undergraduate degree Jack became a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of York. There he was a member of the York Centre for Cross-disciplinary Systems Analysis. He studied concepts in Natural Computing, specifically how to characterize the behaviour of devices composed of several different unconventional computing substrates. He took part in the development of and worked with a MATLAB framework for characterizing the behaviours of these substrates. He also collaborated on and made a significant contribution to a paper presented at the International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation 2019. During this time, Jack not only developed hard skills but also became proficient at giving presentations to and facilitating communication amongst colleagues who are not subject matter experts.
