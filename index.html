            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p >
            Jack's degree in Physics deepened his mathematical literacy and analytical thinking. He found his passion for programming when exposed to it in Fortran and MATLAB as an undergraduate, he is currently training as a C# SDET.

            <p >
            In pursuit of the interest in programming he acquired during his undergraduate degree Jack became a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of York. There he was a member of the York Centre for Cross-disciplinary Systems Analysis. He studied concepts in Natural Computing, specifically how to characterize the behaviour of devices composed of several different unconventional computing substrates. He took part in the development of and worked with a MATLAB framework for characterizing the behaviours of these substrates. He also collaborated on and made a significant contribution to a paper presented at the International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation 2019. During this time, Jack not only developed hard skills but also became proficient at giving presentations to and facilitating communication amongst colleagues who are not subject matter experts.

                                During his time as a student of Physics, Jack picked up an interest in tech and computer science, after graduation he moved to the University of York to pursue a PhD. He studied the interactions between different unconventional computing substrates in the new and evolving field of natural computing. He collaborated as the second author with a Post-Doctoral researcher on a project which resulted in a conference paper. While there he was posted in a cross-disciplinary centre and was exposed to lots of different exciting projects in this area through the range of the sciences, physics, biology, and chemistry, and gained strong skills communicating across the boundaries of different fields.

Final Year Project: Jack conducted computational experiments into the kinetic behaviour of anisotropic colloidal particles as they are adsorbed to liquid-liquid interfaces, for example at an oil-water interface. This involved understanding concepts in He conducted these in a piece of specialist finite-element simulation software Surface Evolver which possesses its own scripting language with which he had no prior experience. With the data from these computational experiments Jack then used Wolfram Mathematica to interpolate the data to produce the adsorption free energy landscape of the system, from which the behaviour of the average particle can be extracted.
